Kaggle Housing Prices Competition
This repo is my attempt to walk through the famous Kaggle Housing Prices Competition.  I'll break it down into the following:
1) EDA Jupyter Notebook
2) Data Transformation Pipeline (py files) - including all the necessary transformers  and custom classes to transform the training/testing dataset
3) Model Notebooks. Initially I've been training a simple regression model but will expand this out to other algorithms
4) Model and Feature Analysis Notebook
